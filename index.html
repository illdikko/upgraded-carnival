                    <h3>Web Development &#128187</h3>
                    <p>I started learning web Development in 2022. I started in a dedicated school but I had to quit in
                        2023. I started learning again on my own a few months later thanks to classes I found on Udemy.

                    <h3>Improv Cooking &#127858</h3>
                    <p>I am the most creative when I need to cook something from scratch with limited ingredients. I am
                        the queen of emptying the fridge and the pantry, and making it delicious.</p>

                    <p>I started embroidery in december 2023 thanks to a Christmas gift. Stabbing repeatedly my work
                        while watching true crime documentaries is the best feeling.</p>

                        boardgames. I used to work as a boardgame sommelier!</p>

                        utmost priorities.</p>

                    <h3>Plants &#127807</h3>
                    <p>I started to take care of plants as a form of self care. So far I own 5 plants, which is not a
                        lot, but I aim to fill my room so that it feels like a jungle. Also, I love the color green.</p>
