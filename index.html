                    <p>I started learning web development in 2022. I started in a dedicated school but had to quit in
                        2023.
                        I started learning again on my own a few months later thanks to classes I found on Udemy. I then went back to school at the EFP in Brussels, a school dedicated to professional training. I am doing a 2-years internship at E-farmz in the meantime.</p>

                    <p>I am the most creative when I need to cook something from scratch with limited ingredients. I am
                        the
                        queen of emptying the fridge and the pantry, and making it delicious.</p>

                    <p>I started embroidery in December 2023 thanks to a Christmas gift. Stabbing repeatedly my work
                        while
                        watching true crime documentaries is the best feeling.</p>

                        lot,
                        but I aim to fill my room so that it feels like a jungle. Also, I love the color green.</p>
